# Solana Devnet Testing

This repository is created for testing purposes on the Solana Devnet network.  
It is part of my learning process for blockchain development and smart contract deployment.  

## Goals
- Interact with Solana programs.
- Experiment with NFTs and token creation on Devnet.
- Practice using Solana CLI and dApps.

## Notes
This project is not intended for production and only serves as a sandbox for experiments.
