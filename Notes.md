# Solana Devnet Experiments ðŸš€

Welcome to my Solana Devnet testing repository.  
This project documents my experiments with the Solana blockchain, focusing on development, deployment, and interaction with programs in a test environment.

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Explore Solana's **Devnet** and **Testnet** environments.
- Learn how to deploy smart contracts (programs) on Solana.
- Practice creating and transferring SPL tokens.
- Experiment with NFT minting and Metaplex integration.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
- **Solana CLI** for on-chain interactions.
- **Phantom Wallet** for managing accounts.
- **Rust** for program development.
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** for client-side scripts.

## ðŸ”¹ Roadmap
1. Setup local development environment.
2. Create and fund Devnet accounts.
3. Deploy a basic Solana program.
4. Create and mint an SPL token.
5. Build a simple dApp to interact with the program.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- All activities in this repo are done on **Devnet** and **Testnet** â€” no real SOL is involved.
- This repository is part of my blockchain learning journey.
- Feel free to fork, clone, or use this project for your own experiments.
